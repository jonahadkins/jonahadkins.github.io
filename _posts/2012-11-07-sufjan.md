My Map Of Sufjan Stevens ‘Iliinois’ Album Took 2nd Place In The Most Unique Category At The 2013 Esri User Conference!!  

**November 7th, 2012**  

_So, i initially had the idea for this when i first purchased the Illinois album way back in 2005. It’s not everyday geography and music collide. The Illinois album is probably one of my top 5 favorite albums ever. Oh, how i wish the 50 states project was a real thing. After pouring over countless websites, lyrics, pictures, i think i’ve incorporated nearly every geographic component off of the two albums. There were many different drafts of directions i could have gone with this map, but i eventually decided on this finished product. It’s available over at my imagekind gallery for purchase. Major Props and Thanks to Sufjan Stevens and Asthmatic Kitty Records._

_Overall, this map took about 3 months of spare time on night and weekends. I used ArcMap 10.1 from start to finish._
