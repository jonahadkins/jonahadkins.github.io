I recently had the great opportunity to help [Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com) with their maps. Flighty is a flight tracking app, but what sets it apart from the rest is a beautiful design, unbelievably fast push notifications, and awesome terminal/gate data.

Improving on the already great design, Flighty's new maps implement many updates, most notably:
  - place names: better scale dependent rendering with an updated class based rank.
  - elevation points: improved scale dependent rendering
  - bathymetry: beautiful natural earth bathymetry using a subtle color palette
  - airports: class based rendering of airports using flight count ranking

 An all new **dark-mode** basemap design was also created. Building upon Mapbox's Dark basemap, updated dark mode (**not black**) colors were implemented across the design to include all the improvements from Flighty's standard basemap. One major difference was using a contrasting (almost crayola) yellow from their app color palette for the airports. This created a cool call out for airport locations when using dark-mode. [Ryan Jones](https://twitter.com/rjonesy), the product lead at Flighty, summed up how hard dark mode map design is with this tweet/video:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dark maps are suuuper hard becuase you need contrast (like water vs land) but canâ€™t use the darker blacks (loses dimension). Look how perfectly <a href="https://twitter.com/jonahadkins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jonahadkins</a> nailed it there and as you zoom in. <a href="https://t.co/MpgvMf5ZBx">pic.twitter.com/MpgvMf5ZBx</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) <a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1173636207688978433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



The dark-mode basemap flows seamlessly with Flighty's gorgeous app design.
