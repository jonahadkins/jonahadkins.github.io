About 2 years ago I created the first edition,[ unofficial map of the Noland Trail](http://jonahsmaps.tumblr.com/post/55516350234/the-noland-trail-is-a-well-known-park-in-newport). It was side project of mine to create an all inclusive complete map of the park and trail. I threw a ton of information on the first one, probably too much and it had many ‘GIS-y’ type elements that were lost on the casual map viewer. With this second edition, I wanted to strip away the bulkiness of the original, maintain a high level of detail, and improve the original design.  

The second edition uses data I collected and [open-sourced](http://jonahadkins.github.io/open-noland-trail/), and topographic data from&nbsp;[OpenTopography.org](http://www.opentopography.org/) .
