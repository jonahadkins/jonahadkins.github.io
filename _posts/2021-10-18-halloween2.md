tl;dr - Visit [This is Halloween Part II](https://www.jonahadkins.com/halloween2/)

Sometimes API's go on to the next life, never to be seen or heard from again. Like [this app](http://jonahadkins.com/halloween/) I made a few years ago.

It's dead. Rather, through some cosmic event, it's reanimated, shuffling through the web in zombie form, only a shell of it's former self.
Given the _spirit_ of the season, I thought it'd be fun to resurrect this old app. In case you forgot, here's the deets about it.


>Costume Pop-up shops are an interesting concept that breathes new (but temporary) life into the
abandoned, dead, and closed medium and big-box stores across the country. Have an old Toys-R-Us
or Circuit City near you? Chances are it will be occupied by a costume pop-up shop after Labor
Day. For the 2 main retailers, Halloween City and Spirt Halloween Costumes, it's a great model
to capitalize on the spirit of the season. Digging in to [Spirit's website](https://www.spirithalloween.com/content.jsp?pageName=RealEst),
it reads like a problem from a GIS textbook.


>Spirit is ideally looking for temporary 3 MONTH leases that include a kick-out clause
(should the landlord secure a permanent deal by June). Since Spirit locations open on or
about Labor Day and remain open through November 1st, our ideal lease would run from August
1st through mid-November. To achieve this, we scour the country, making our site selections
from January through August. We like to locate our stores in power centers, strip centers,
free-standing stores, major downtown retail locations and in major malls surrounded by a
national retailer mix. Our aim is to set up in communities that have 1) a population of
approximately 35,000+, 2) living within a 3-5 mile radius, and 3) with a car count of at
least 25,000 cars per day. Our flexibility is key! While our ideal locations feature between
5,000 to 50,000 square feet of sales floor space with awesome visibility, no store is too
large (or too small). We can even adapt to a space with as little as 3,000 square feet.

And who can forgot this quote from my friend [Katie](https://twitter.com/KatieKowalsky):
>"...the ephemeral nature of these stores combined with the prolonged death of brick and mortar shops makes this a fascinating and uniquely american-phenomenon.."

Some of the same guts from the old app (which you can [read all about here](http://jonahadkins/cartography/tangram/here/2019/10/25/halloween.html)) have been
transplanted into this new version, with a few exceptions:

- **Protomaps** | the map tiles come from [Brandon Liu's](https://twitter.com/bdon_) awesome [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com). This is a great, new suite of
tools for web-mapping. I'm only using the [Maps API](https://protomaps.com/docs/web-api) for the basemap, but there's a whole bunch of cool offerings like a
js map renderer, serverless tiles, and OSM extracts. Switching to the Protomaps tile schema was pretty seamleass and provided an easy way to serve my
Haunted Mansion themed basemap.

- **Nominatim** | i've switched geocoding from the HERE API to [Nominatim](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim) - no big reason other than having to
provide an API Key for Here.

And that's about it. Reanimating this app for a sequel was fun, refreshing weekend project to keep the seasonal vibrations going. Unlike most sequels, I hope this one
is better than the original. Enjoy. ðŸ‘» ðŸ‘» ðŸ‘»
