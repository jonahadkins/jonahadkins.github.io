tl;dr  [I'm a 2018 Board Member for OpenStreetMap US](http://www.openstreetmap.us/2018/02/board-elections-results/)

<hr>

Surprise! I got elected to the 2018 OpenStreetMap US Board. I can't wait to contribute to the overall goals of the board this year, which include hiring an Executive Director, planning the State of the Map US Conference, and most importantly supporting the awesome OSM community.

Stay tuned for more OSM updates throughout the year.

### Position Statement

My name is Jonah Adkins. I am a cartographer from Newport News, Virginia. I have been working with maps & GIS technology since 1999, with local governments, federal agencies, and most recently as a consultant.

I'm a regular editor of OpenStreetMap since [November of 2013](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/?Jonah%20Adkins). To date, Ive been mostly a [silent contributor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jonahadkins), but I'm looking to change that with your vote!

I have some previous organizational experience from being involved with and a 2 year stint as Vice-President with Virginia Association of Mapping & Land Surveying, a local organizer of Maptime! Hampton Roads, and volunteering with Code for Hampton Roads.

I'm most eager to bring a fresh perspective to the board and look forward to fostering a community of inclusion, diversity, and belonging for anyone involved with OpenStreetMap US.
