York County, Virginia GIS department has provided building footprints, address points, and points of interest for importing into OpenStreetMap after a request via email. The data was graciously provided as is, license free, and at no cost by the GIS department with the note:  
"..York County’s FOIA policy still allows our department to charge for GIS data, however we have decided to provide some GIS data to not for profit organizations.."
