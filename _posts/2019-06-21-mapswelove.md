Probably one of the cooler things to happen to me in a while - the [One City Marathon map](https://www.jonahadkins.com/photoshop/openstreetmap/cartography/2017/02/23/one-city-marathon.html) is now a [**Maps We Love**](https://www.esri.com/en-us/maps-we-love/gallery/one-city-marathon) on Esri's website! It's an honor to be featured among the likes of Heather Smith, John Nelson, and Sarah Bell. Also, big shoutout to [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sarahbellmaps), who took some rough notes and turned it into the incredible feature on their site - thanks Sarah!
