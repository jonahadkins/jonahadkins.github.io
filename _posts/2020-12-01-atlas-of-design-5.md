Just in case you needed to see my big dumb face, be sure to check out the 5th edition of
the [Atlas of Design](https://atlasofdesign.bigcartel.com). The latest volume is out now
and features tons lovely maps from some of the worlds best cartographers. While my map submission
didnt make the cut, I was humbled to be asked to contribute WORDS to the forward. The prompt
was:


>How does technology affect your work and design process? How has technology changed your design process over time How does it affect the way you think about your work in terms of aesthetics or achieving results?
