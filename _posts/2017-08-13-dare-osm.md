### Import Notes  

18,430 Total Buildings

Imports will be done through the dedicated user account [jonahadkins_dare_import](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jonahadkins_dare_imports) and will be done through OSM Import Guidelines - [See Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dare_County_Building_Import)  

A workable building polygon file was created from provided building footprints and a parcel polygon shapefile. Attributes from the parcels including address and parcel use were transferred over to the building footprints.

Imported buildings have the following `building=` tags populated:  

| Building  |   Count |   Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| apartments  | 220  |
| church (building = yes) | 36  | amenity = place_of_worship  |
| commercial  | 317  |
| hotel (building = yes)  | 131  | tourism = hotel  |
| industrial  | 56  |
| public  | 104  |
| residential  | 16,481  |
| retail  | 187  |
| school  | 8  |
| shed  | 327  |
| yes  | 750  |
