Check out my pre-election Position Statement below for more information about me and why I ran.

### Position Statement

My name is Jonah Adkins. I am a cartographer from Newport News, Virginia. I have been working with maps & GIS technology since 1999, with local governments, federal agencies, and most recently as a consultant. I've been regular editor of OpenStreetMap since [November of 2013](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/?Jonah%20Adkins).

I was elected to the Board in 2018 and thoroughly enjoyed participating as a board member during the past year. I had the opportunity to represent the community at large events like SOTMUS and NACIS, as well as locally during the Detroit Mapping Challenge and in the #virginia channel on slack. I'm eager to continue bringing a fresh perspective to the board and look forward to fostering a community of inclusion, diversity, and belonging for anyone involved with OpenStreetMap US.
