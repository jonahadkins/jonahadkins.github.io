tl;dr  [Atlas of Design Volume 4 Finalists Announced!](http://atlasofdesign.org/2018/05/16/2018-finalists/)

<hr>

Very honored and very humbled that the [One City Marathon](http://jonahadkins.com/photoshop/openstreetmap/cartography/2017/02/23/one-city-marathon.html) map was among 32 selected out of hundreds for Volume 4 of the Atlas of Design. As a so-called cartographer, not sure it gets better.
