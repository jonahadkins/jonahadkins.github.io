I was _beyond_ honored to be asked to particiapte in this years NACIS Quilt! The quilt is a collaborative map/art project that grids out a location into 10 tiles that are then mapped without any design rules. It's especially cool this year because the map location is my home area of Hampton Roads. It's amazing to see the 10 distinct perspectives come together in a uniquely harmonious way.

This year's quilt featured designs by Katie Kowalsky, Dylan Moriarty, Vicky Johnson, Josie Sajbel, David Lambert, FranÃ§Ois Goulet, Elaine Guidero, Damien Saunder, Laris Karklis, and myself.
