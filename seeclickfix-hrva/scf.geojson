There have been several reports called into the local police and there have been several of my neighbors posting online about the make-shift raceway. I am afraid to let my children play outside for fear of a terrible accident. I have been nearly rear-ended several times when exiting my driveway. The most the city has ever done is post a digital speedometer to make people aware of how fast they are traveling. That was totally insiginificant. No one expects any changes just by recognizing that they are speeding at the moment. By the time they get to the end of the neighborhood, it is irrelevant. Areas around town have vacant police cars sitting around to deter the speeding. That is an awesome idea because people are more apt to do what is expected of a driver when a police car is present. Placing a vehicle between royal grant drive and queenswood terrace would catch the speeders as they enter and exit the neighborhood. This would prompt them to slow down. That particular area of the neighborhood is plagued with speeders, unsafe u-turns, cars parking illegally, blocking of through traffic and it happens to be where the school buses tend to do drop-offs and pick-ups. Essentially, that area is a haven for close calls and unsafe activities. It would be nice to have our neighborhood be privy to the sepcial circumstances that prompt the local police to place a cop car in our neighborhood. I once loved our peacefull neighborhood, but now i am uncertain as to whether or not i will even walk my dog during certain times of the day. It isn't desirable to know that virtually nothing is being done to help with this obvious saftey issue. Perhaps we as tax-paying citizens should band together and put down speed bumps in the neighborhood. Perhaps that would slow people down.","rating":2,"address":"516 Royal Grant Drive Chesapeake, VA","closed_at":"","acknowledged_at":"","created_at":"2013-01-23T10:35:17-05:00","updated_at":"2013-01-23T10:54:29-05:00","shortened_url":"http://bit.ly/UUBJbV","media/video_url":"","media/image_full":"","media/image_square_100x100":"","media/representative_image_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/traffic.png","point/type":"Point","point/coordinates/0":-76.249672,"point/coordinates/1":36.693171,"url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/368236","html_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/issues/368236","comment_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/368236/comments","flag_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/368236/flag","transitions/close_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/368236/close","reporter/id":0,"reporter/name":"Anonymous","reporter/witty_title":"Street Smart","reporter/role":"Registered User","reporter/civic_points":0,"reporter/avatar/full":"https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png","reporter/avatar/square_100x100":"https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png","marker-symbol":"chesapeake"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.249672,36.693171]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":197027,"status":"Open","summary":"Rezoning on Bruce Road","description":"I oppose the rezoning on Bruce road, the schools all overcrowded, trying to negotiate out of my neighbor is impossible during the am and pm hours heightened during the school transfer.
