  - Great info about usage of a tag, or combination of tags. Sometimes it's best to go with what's being used the most.
- Ask the community!
  - There's a large community of OSM mappers (Lists, Slack, Twitter, etc.), and there's usually someone who's an expert in mapping a particular feature. Just have to ask!
- Explore the map!
  - Sometimes the best way to figure out the best way to tag a feature is to browse the map and see how others are doing it.
