###So...
*i got [this shirt](https://www.instagram.com/p/i1fJNMCBUr/) a few years ago, i've always equated it's design to "Symbols on a Map", and i've always wanted to make them legit map symbols. thus...*

# hipster_makis
my first attempt at [Maki-Style](https://github.com/mapbox/maki) symbols  
15 icons i can only describe as `hipster-esque map symbols from a forgotten map of farm to table farms`  
* license and hormone free, do with them what you will, have your cake and eat it too, and have other people watch you while you eat it.  
* pull requests most welcome, im 100% sure they could have been drawn better  
* 24px sized svg's, perfect for that `mapbox studio` project you've had on the back-burner  
* add unpresedented levels of personal curation by using [maki-chef](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-chef/)    
* includes seamless pattern png, perfect for [cool new homepage](http://jonahadkins.github.io) backgrounds  

*all design credit to [RCVA](https://www.rvca.com), the manufacturer of the shirt.*
